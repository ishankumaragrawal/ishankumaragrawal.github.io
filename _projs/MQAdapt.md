      <strong>MQAdapt</strong> explores whether <em>Multi-Query Attention (MQA)</em> can be adaptively applied at inference time to reduce compute and memory usage in transformer models, with minimal performance drop. 
      Motivated by the success of inference-time optimizations like GQA and PTQ, we investigate three research questions: 
      <strong>RQ1</strong>: Does MQA reduce inference latency? 
      <strong>RQ2</strong>: Are some transformer layers more sensitive to MQA than others? 
      <strong>RQ3</strong>: How can we best select layers for MQA under a given budget?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our experiments show a linear improvement in compute and memory efficiency with increasing MQA layers. 
      However, layer sensitivity varies significantly â€” lower layers are more critical to overall performance, while alternating layers helps preserve accuracy. 
      Greedy strategies that apply MQA to consecutive layers lead to steep accuracy drops, while <em>alternating layer sampling</em> stabilizes performance, enabling up to 5 layers to use MQA with negligible loss. 
      MQAdapt offers a practical path to inference-time efficiency gains without retraining, especially promising for long-context generation tasks.
