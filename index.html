<p>
Hi I‚Äôm Ishan Kumar, a second year MS CS student at Columbia University, pursuing the Machine Learning Track. Previously I was a Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft India. I worked in the Search Technology Center, India as part of the Segments Team of Bing for 2 Years.
</p>

<p>
During the summer of 2025, I am interning at the JP Morgan Machine Learning Center of Excellence as an Applied Science Intern, where I will be diving deep into <b>LLM Evals</b> and building better systems to evaluate the internal RAG and QA pipelines.
</p>

<p>
I also work as a part-time research assistant in Professor Goldblum‚Äôs lab, where we are exploring the unique structure of Diffusion Language Models to speed up their inference.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, I was a part-time researcher in the Natural Language Processing Lab at ETH, working on Causality and NLP under the supervision of <a href="https://zhijing-jin.com">Zhijing Jin</a>, Prof. <a href="http://www.mrinmaya.io/">Mrinmaya Sachan</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://is.mpg.de/~bs">Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf</a>. Our work <b>CausalCite</b> was published in <b>ACL 2024</b>.
</p>

<p>
I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee during which I was also a Research Student in the Molecular Simulations and Drug Delivery Research Group in IIT Roorkee with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitr.ac.in/msdd/home?authuser=0">Prateek Jha</a>. Previously, I have also interned with the <b>Video Analytics Lab, IISc</b> with Prof. <a href="https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/index.html">Venkatesh Babu</a>.
</p>

<p>
I read that over 90% of ML models never end up getting deployed, and I decided I want to change that. I am passionate about <b>improving inference time optimisations for LLMs</b> to improve their deployability (<i>dLLMs</i>, which have the potential to output &gt;1 tokens at a time, is one way of doing that‚Äîbut I love to explore different directions like MQAdapt). I am also interested in leveraging Gen AI to solve real-world user problems and drive solutions end to end. Please reach out if you are interested in working together!

<p>
 I like to contribute to Open Source, in the past I have actively contributed to PyTorch Ignite <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/ignite"> PyTorch-Ignite </a> (one of their Top-10 <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/graphs/contributors">Contributors</a>!), which is a High-level library to help with training and evaluating neural networks.
</p>


<p>
During the period of April to Nov of 2020, I worked with <a href="https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/">Video Analytics Lab</a>, IISc on a task of Self Supervised Hand Mesh Detection and Color Recovery. The purpose of doing this in a self supervised manner was to use the large number of unlabelled data available on the internet and makes the model more robust since its trained on real world outdoors data also.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 2020, I worked with CNeRG Group</a>, IIT Kharagpur on a task of Question Answering on the AmazonQA Dataset. It was a Reading Comprehension task where the the questions had to be answered using the reviews as context.
</p>



<h1> Interests </h1>
