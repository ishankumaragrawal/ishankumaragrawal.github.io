<p>
I'm Ishan Kumar, a Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft India. I work in the Search Technology Center, India as part of the Segments Team of Bing.
</p>
<p>
I also work as a Remote Research Assistant in the Natural Language Processing Lab at ETH, working on Causality and NLP under the supervision of <a href= "https://zhijing-jin.com">Zhijing Jin</a>, Prof. <a href= "http://www.mrinmaya.io/">Mrinmaya Sachan</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://is.mpg.de/~bs">Bernhard Schölkopf</a>.
<br>
I obtained my Bachelor's Degree at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee during which I was also a Research Student in the Molecular Simulations and Drug Delivery Research Group in IIT Roorkee with Prof.<a href= "https://sites.google.com/iitr.ac.in/msdd/home?authuser=0"> Prateek Jha</a>. Previously, I have also interned with Video Analytics Lab, IISc with Prof. <a href="https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/index.html">Venkatesh Babu</a>.
</p>
<p>
I read that over 90% of ML models never end up getting deployed, and I decided I want to change that.
I am passionate about <b>Applied Machine Learning</b>. My research interests include NLP, Large language models, information extraction and ML in Education.

 I like to contribute to Open Source, in the past I have actively contributed to PyTorch Ignite <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/ignite"> PyTorch-Ignite </a> (one of their Top-10 <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/graphs/contributors">Contributors</a>!), which is a High-level library to help with training and evaluating neural networks.

<p>
During the period of April to Nov of 2020, I worked with <a href="https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/">Video Analytics Lab</a>, IISc on a task of Self Supervised Hand Mesh Detection and Color Recovery. The purpose of doing this in a self supervised manner was to use the large number of unlabelled data available on the internet and makes the model more robust since its trained on real world outdoors data also.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 2020, I worked with CNeRG Group</a>, IIT Kharagpur on a task of Question Answering on the AmazonQA Dataset. It was a Reading Comprehension task where the the questions had to be answered using the reviews as context.

<h1> Interests </h1>
<p>
Natural Language Processing, improving conditioning on Generation models and ensuring the results are bias free.
Summarisation, Question Answering.
Machine Learning for Life Sciences, Chemistry
<!-- I am exploring work at the interesection of Machine Learning with
 Chemistry and Language, doing so to solve real world problems -->
</p>
<!--
<p>
 <em>Deep Learning on Molecular Data for Activity Prediction</em>. I worked on a course project on the topic <i>"Generating Molecular Embeddings for QSAR using Adversarial Autoencoder"</i> for the course IEE-03 Artifical Neural Networks and Applications. This project was also awarded the best course project award by the Prof.. I am looking to undertake more work to explore this area further.
